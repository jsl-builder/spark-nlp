## 3.4.0

#### Overview

Signature Detection in image-based documents.

#### New Features

* [ImageSignatureDetector](ocr_object_detection#imagesignaturedetector) is a DL model for detect signature on the image.


#### New notebooks

* [Image Signature Detection example](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-ocr-workshop/blob/3.4.0/jupyter/SparkOcrImageSignatureDetection.ipynb)


## 3.3.0

#### Overview

Table detection and recognition for scanned documents.

For table detection we added ___ImageTableDetector___. 
It based on __CascadeTabNet__ which used _Cascade mask Region-based CNN High-Resolution Network_ (Cascade mask R-CNN HRNet).
Model was pre-trained on the __COCO dataset__ and fine tuned on __ICDAR 2019__ competitions dataset for table detection. It demonstrates state of the art results for ICDAR 2013 and TableBank. And top results for ICDAR 2019.

## Import Transformers into Spark NLP

### Overview

Spark NLP üöÄ  3.1.0 is out! We have extended support for HuggingFace ü§ó  exported models in equivalent Spark NLP annotators. Starting this release, you can easily use `saved_model` feature in HuggingFace within a few lines of codes and import any BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, BertForTokenClassification, and DistilBertForTokenClassification models to Spark NLP. We will work on the remaining annotators and extend this support to the rest with each release üòä

### Compatibility

**Spark NLP**: The equivalent annotator in Spark NLP
**TF Hub**: Models from [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev/)
**HuggingFace**: Models from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models)
**Model Architecture**: Which architecture is compatible with that annotator
**Flags**:

- Fully supported ‚úÖ
- Partially supported (requires workarounds) ‚úîÔ∏è
- Under development ‚ùé
- Not supported ‚ùå

### Limitations

- If you are importing models from HuggingFace as Embeddings they must be for the `Fill-Mask` task. Meaning you cannot use a model in BertEmbeddings if they were trained or fine-tuned on token/text classification tasks in HuggingFace. They have a different architecture.
- There is a 2G size limitation with loading a TF SavedModel model in Spark NLP. Your model cannot be larger than 2G size or you will see the following error: `Required array size too large.` (We are working on going around this Java limitation, however, for the time being, there are some models which are over 2G and they are not compatible)

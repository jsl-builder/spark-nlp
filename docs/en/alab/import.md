Once a new project is created and its configuration is saved, the user is redirected to the **Import page**. Here the user has multiple options for importing tasks.

## Plain text file 
When you upload a plain text file, only one task will be created which will contain the entire data in the input file.

This is an update from versions of Annotation Lab when the input text file was split by the new line character and one task was created for each line.

## Json file
For bulk importing a list of documents you can use the json import option. The expected format is illustrated in the image below. It consists of a list of dictionaries, each with 2 keys-values pairs  (“text” and “title”). 

```bash
[{  "text": "Task text content.", "title":"Task title"}]
```


## CSV, TSV file
When CSV / TSV formatted text file is used, column names are interpreted as task data keys:

```bash
Task text content, Task title
this is a first task, Colon Cancer.txt
this is a second task, Breast radiation therapy.txt
```

## Import annotated tasks

When importing tasks that already contain annotations (e.g. exported from another project, with predictions generated by pre-trained models) the user has the option to	overwrite completions/predictions or to skip the tasks that are already imported into the project. 
<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/annotation_lab/1.6.0/overwrite.png" style="width:100%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

## Import Paginated tasks
 
Pagination is a way of showing the text on multiple pages rather than putting them on a single page. This makes the UI more responsive as the annotations are spread across multiple pages.
 
In order to implement the pagination, we add the tag `<pagebreak>` after a chunk of text before importing the task.

Import from JSON:

```bash
{"text":"TEXT IN PAGE 1 <pagebreak> TEXT IN PAGE 2"}
```

Import from text file:

```bash
TEXT IN PAGE 1

BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 53-year-old female with history of hysterectomy presented with vaginal vault prolapse. 
The patient had good support in the anterior vagina and in the posterior vagina but had significant apical prolapse. 
Options such as watchful waiting, pessary, abdominal surgery, robotic sacrocolpopexy versus open sacrocolpopexy were discussed.

<pagebreak>

TEXT IN PAGE 2

The patient already had multiple abdominal scars. Risk of open surgery was little bit higher for the patient. After 
discussing the options the patient wanted to proceed a Pfannenstiel incision and repair of the sacrocolpopexy. Risks 
of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, mesh erogenic exposure, complications with mesh were discussed. 

<pagebreak>

TEXT IN PAGE 3

The patient already had multiple abdominal scars. Risk of open surgery was little bit higher for the patient. 
After discussing the options the patient wanted to proceed a Pfannenstiel incision and repair of the sacrocolpopexy. 
Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, mesh erogenic exposure, complications with mesh were 
discussed. The patient understood the risks of recurrence, etc, and wanted to proceed with the procedure. 
```

When you upload the text file, a task will be created which will contain the entire data in the input file in paginated form.

we'll obtain the output illustrated below:
<img class="image image--xl" src="/assets/images/annotation_lab/2.6.0/pagination_gif.gif" style="width:100%; align:center; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);"/>

When a task is paginated relations cannot be created between inter-page labels.
